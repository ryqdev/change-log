# change-log

## 0.0.2
After exploring plenty of developing tools, I decide to use the following tool combination:
- Developing: Codespace
- WebPage Deploying: Vercel
- Server Deploying: Fly.io


## 0.0.1 
- Use codespace as my developing environment.
- Use fly.io to deploy my service instead of setting up a VPS from scratch.
